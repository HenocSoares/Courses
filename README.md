# some100DaysOfCodeChallenges
Some (perhaps several in future times) 100 Days of Code challenges. Starting out with Replit's one (https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=100_days_of_code_python).

I already know some stuff, so I might get ahead on the counting (daily base overall).
