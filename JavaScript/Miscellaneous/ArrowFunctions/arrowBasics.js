// This file not necessarily will run and work, the idea is the study of the concepts, for now:

// The following is the most classical way of declaring and using a function
function sum (a, b) {
  return a + b
}

// Ahead we have an arrow function, where the 'function' keyword will not be necessary:
// The arrow will go:
const sum (a, b) => {
  return a + b
}

// Now, ahead, we have 'sum' as an arrow function

/*
As per GPT: 'Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous functions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions. Arrow functions are particularly useful for short, simple functions and also introduce a more predictable behavior for the this keyword.'
