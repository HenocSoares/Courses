// Important to notice: JS is case sensitive!
// Also, the use of semicolons provide better readability and avoid errors as it tells the compiler the statement has ended
// So, although JavaScript does not require semicolons at the end of every statement, itâ€™s a good practice to include them for better readability and to avoid potential errors.

// As seen above, whitespace is crucial for maintaining readability. While it may not be essential for functionality, it plays a vital role in ensuring clarity for human readers!
// Also, the white space goes for around assignement operators, too, as an additional example (=) => improving readability.
// Indentation is another great aspect to pay attention to when it comes to readability.
// Comments themselves also improves readability when used correctly and not much. This very case is particular as this file is meant for learning and annotation.
